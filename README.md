# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

So my name is obviously deexno and all you need to know is that I will post here some projects which could be helpful in your life as a sys-admin, it is also possible that I will post here in future some Write-UPs to CTFs.

I also write German tutorials on <a href="https://deexno.github.io/">deexno.github.io</a> about pentesting, networking, programming and Linux, so if you' re interested don't forget to visit me there.
